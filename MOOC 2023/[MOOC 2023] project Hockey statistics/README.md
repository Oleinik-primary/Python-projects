The application examines hockey league statistics from the NHL in a couple of different ways. A proper json file is specified at start. Comments in the code explain used methods.

The project was made using the majority of learned python functionality on the project. 

Available commands:
- 0 - *quit*
- 1 - *search for player*
- 2 - *teams*
- 3 - *countries*
- 4 - *players in team*
- 5 - *players from country*
- 6 - *most points*
- 7 - *most goals*


Additions and fixes to consider:
- input validation for inner methods
- file data validation (present or not, corrupted etc.)
- json file input should directly into application without calling the application associated methods
- format improvements
